Progress

* 23 Jun 2013
  - When MacPorts won't download files for you, you can manually download them and stick them in [Macports root]/var/macports/distfiles. But why does MacPorts fail to fetch so often? EDIT: proxy problems, of course.
  - Sticking this here since I forget it so often. To change the default (python or whatever) version in macports, do

    port select --list python

  - Fixed pyquante2 orbital symmetry bug, which wasn't a bug but arose from my missing a transpose.
  - Prettified the pyquante2 plotting routines, and added to IPython notebook.
  - Got proper X, CNOT, and CPHASE gates to work in Sympy
