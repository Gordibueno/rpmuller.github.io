Progress
========
* 11 Jul 2013
  - Further edits and simplifications to the sympy qcircuit branch.
  - Pull request sent for first batch of sympy qcircuit changes.
* 10 Jul 2013
  - Testing vwn5 and b88 functionals.
  - Touched the sympy circuit printing just so I wouldn't go too long without working on it.
    Positively stupid wire labelling implemented.
  - Labelled wires now work in sympy.
  - ![Labeled wires](https://github.com/rpmuller/rpmuller.github.io/raw/master/qft-labelled.png)
* 9 Jul 2013
  - Testing lda functionals.
* 8 Jul 2013
  - Minor cleaning and updating.
  - Started to work on DFT functionals and (more importantly) a test suite for DFT functionals
* 7 Jul 2013
  - Debugging radial meshes:
  - ![radial](https://raw.github.com/rpmuller/rpmuller.github.io/master/radial-meshses.png)
* 6 Jul 2013
  - pyquante2 now has a rudimentary pyglet-based viewer
  - Advanced DFT meshes.
  - ![Plotting of DFT Meshes](https://raw.github.com/rpmuller/rpmuller.github.io/master/h2o-mesh.png)
* 5 Jul 2013
  - Simplified arguments to mp2, and moved int transformation to
    integral module. 
* 4 Jul 2013
  - More work on dft grids.
* 3 Jul 2013
  - Work started on dft grids.
  - Release of  [Crash Course in Python for
    Scientists](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/5920182)! 
* 2 Jul 2013
  - Feature to mesh entire basis set not added and tested.
  - Lineplot and Contourplot modules simplified.
  - MP2 now works.
* 1 Jul 2013
  - Einsum: Mind == Blown! Don't have good intuition for either
    np.einsum or np.tensordot, so I've decided  to write a tutorial
    for both, since they contain some nice tensor contractions that
    can seriously  speed a scientific calculation. 
    [Know of any good tutorials for either](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1hf4i6/good_documentation_for_tensordot_and_einsum/)? 
    Let me know, either by posting to the reddit thread or emailing
    rpmuller@gmail.com. 
  - Major speed up to the pyquante2 integral code by using the
    bad-assedness of einsum.
