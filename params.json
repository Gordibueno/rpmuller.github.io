Can't seem to get anything but segfaults! Cython makes things much nicer, but I'm having trouble getting it to recognize _Complex\r\n  - When MacPorts won't download files for you, you can manually download them and stick them in [Macports root]/var/macports/distfiles. But why does MacPorts fail to fetch so often? EDIT: proxy problems, of course.\r\n  - Sticking this here since I forget it so often. To change the default (python or whatever) version in macports, do\r\n\r\n    port select --list python\r\n\r\n* 22 Jun 2013\r\n  - Fixed pyquante2 orbital symmetry bug, which wasn't a bug but arose from my missing a transpose.\r\n  - Prettified the pyquante2 plotting routines, and added to IPython notebook.\r\n  - Got proper X, CNOT, and CPHASE gates to work in Sympy\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n=====\r\n* [My Sandia Homepage](http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~rmuller).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
