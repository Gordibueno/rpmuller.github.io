Moved test code into an ipython notebook and also compared to the PW Correlation\r\n* 19 Jul 2013\r\n  - Trying to debug VWN. Not having much luck.\r\n* 18 Jul 2013\r\n  - Created a new sympy branch off of master to handle qasm parsing.\r\n* 17 Jul 2013\r\n  - Trying to support SVWN, PBE, BLYP functionals. Tests for all exchange functionals work. Tests for all correlation functionals fail. :-(\r\n* 16 Jul 2013\r\n  - [Pull request submitted](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/2294) for second set of changes to sympy\r\n    circuit plotting.\r\n  - pyquante2 xpbe tests pass.\r\n* 15 Jul 2013\r\n  - qcircuit_measurement branch created to hack measurements into \r\n    circuit plotting.\r\n  - Initial set of hacks done: horizontal wires now doubled.\r\n* 14 Jul 2013\r\n  - First set of qcircuit hacks merged into master!\r\n  - Outlined thoughts on [implementing measurement](https://github.com/rpmuller/rpmuller.github.io/blob/master/MeasurementThoughts.md) in sympy circuitplot.\r\n* 13 Jul 2013\r\n  - Trying to get Travis to accept my sympy changes for quantum circuits.\r\n    Travis [appears to be working now](https://travis-ci.org/sympy/sympy/builds/9038252).\r\n  - Travis now also regularly builds/tests pyquante2\r\n  - pyquante2 test suite now runs without matplotlib or pyglet installed.\r\n  - You can now do this Steane check with only 7 lines of code:\r\n  - ![steane check](https://raw.github.com/rpmuller/rpmuller.github.io/master/steane.png)\r\n\r\n[Older Progress](https://github.com/rpmuller/rpmuller.github.io/blob/master/Older.md)\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n=====\r\n* [My Sandia Homepage](http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~rmuller).\r\n* [Citations on Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ihGf4wgAAAAJ&hl=en).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
